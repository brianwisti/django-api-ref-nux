    "docstring": "\"\"\"\n    Evaluate a variable, and if that variable is \"true\" (i.e., exists, is not\n    empty, and is not a false boolean value), output the contents of the block:\n\n    ::\n\n        {% if athlete_list %}\n            Number of athletes: {{ athlete_list|count }}\n        {% elif athlete_in_locker_room_list %}\n            Athletes should be out of the locker room soon!\n        {% else %}\n            No athletes.\n        {% endif %}\n\n    In the above, if ``athlete_list`` is not empty, the number of athletes will\n    be displayed by the ``{{ athlete_list|count }}`` variable.\n\n    The ``if`` tag may take one or several `` {% elif %}`` clauses, as well as\n    an ``{% else %}`` clause that will be displayed if all previous conditions\n    fail. These clauses are optional.\n\n    ``if`` tags may use ``or``, ``and`` or ``not`` to test a number of\n    variables or to negate a given variable::\n\n        {% if not athlete_list %}\n            There are no athletes.\n        {% endif %}\n\n        {% if athlete_list or coach_list %}\n            There are some athletes or some coaches.\n        {% endif %}\n\n        {% if athlete_list and coach_list %}\n            Both athletes and coaches are available.\n        {% endif %}\n\n        {% if not athlete_list or coach_list %}\n            There are no athletes, or there are some coaches.\n        {% endif %}\n\n        {% if athlete_list and not coach_list %}\n            There are some athletes and absolutely no coaches.\n        {% endif %}\n\n    Comparison operators are also available, and the use of filters is also\n    allowed, for example::\n\n        {% if articles|length >= 5 %}...{% endif %}\n\n    Arguments and operators _must_ have a space between them, so\n    ``{% if 1>2 %}`` is not a valid if tag.\n\n    All supported operators are: ``or``, ``and``, ``in``, ``not in``\n    ``==``, ``!=``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``<`` and ``<=``.\n\n    Operator precedence follows Python.\n    \"\"\"",
