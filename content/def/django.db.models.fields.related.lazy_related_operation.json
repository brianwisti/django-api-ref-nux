Each subsequent positional\n    argument is another model, or a reference to another model - see\n    `resolve_relation()` for the various forms these may take. Any relative\n    references will be resolved relative to `model`.\n\n    This is a convenience wrapper for `Apps.lazy_model_operation` - the app\n    registry model used is the one found in `model._meta.apps`.\n    \"\"\"",
