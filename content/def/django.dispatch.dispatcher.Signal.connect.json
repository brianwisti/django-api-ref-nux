Must either be\n                a Python object, or None to receive events from any sender.\n\n            weak\n                Whether to use weak references to the receiver. By default, the\n                module will attempt to use weak references to the receiver\n                objects. If this parameter is false, then strong references will\n                be used.\n\n            dispatch_uid\n                An identifier used to uniquely identify a particular instance of\n                a receiver. This will usually be a string, though it may be\n                anything hashable.\n        \"\"\"",
