    "docstring": "\"\"\"\n        Build a WhereNode for a single filter clause but don't add it\n        to this Query. Query.add_q() will then add this filter to the where\n        Node.\n\n        The 'branch_negated' tells us if the current branch contains any\n        negations. This will be used to determine if subqueries are needed.\n\n        The 'current_negated' is used to determine if the current filter is\n        negated or not and this will be used to determine if IS NULL filtering\n        is needed.\n\n        The difference between current_negated and branch_negated is that\n        branch_negated is set on first negation, but current_negated is\n        flipped for each negation.\n\n        Note that add_filter will not do any negating itself, that is done\n        upper in the code by add_q().\n\n        The 'can_reuse' is a set of reusable joins for multijoins.\n\n        The method will create a filter clause that can be added to the current\n        query. However, if the filter isn't added to the query then the caller\n        is responsible for unreffing the joins used.\n        \"\"\"",
