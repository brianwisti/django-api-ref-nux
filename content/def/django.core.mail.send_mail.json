All members\n    of the recipient list will see the other recipients in the 'To' field.\n\n    If from_email is None, use the DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL setting.\n    If auth_user is None, use the EMAIL_HOST_USER setting.\n    If auth_password is None, use the EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD setting.\n\n    Note: The API for this method is frozen. New code wanting to extend the\n    functionality should use the EmailMessage class directly.\n    \"\"\"",
