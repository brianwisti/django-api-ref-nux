Please refer to the BASH\n        man-page for more information about this variables.\n\n        Subcommand options are saved as pairs. A pair consists of\n        the long option string (e.g. '--exclude') and a boolean\n        value indicating if the option requires arguments. When printing to\n        stdout, an equal sign is appended to options which require arguments.\n\n        Note: If debugging this function, it is recommended to write the debug\n        output in a separate file. Otherwise the debug output will be treated\n        and formatted as potential completion suggestions.\n        \"\"\"",
