A new token is created if one is not already set.\n\n    A side effect of calling this function is to make the csrf_protect\n    decorator and the CsrfViewMiddleware add a CSRF cookie and a 'Vary: Cookie'\n    header to the outgoing response.  For this reason, you may need to use this\n    function lazily, as is done by the csrf context processor.\n    \"\"\"",
