In other words, this keyword enables the user\n           to selectively import a subset range of features in the geographic\n           data source.\n\n         step:\n           If set with an integer, transactions will occur at every step\n           interval. For example, if step=1000, a commit would occur after\n           the 1,000th feature, the 2,000th feature etc.\n\n         progress:\n           When this keyword is set, status information will be printed giving\n           the number of features processed and successfully saved.  By default,\n           progress information will pe printed every 1000 features processed,\n           however, this default may be overridden by setting this keyword with an\n           integer for the desired interval.\n\n         stream:\n           Status information will be written to this file handle.  Defaults to\n           using `sys.stdout`, but any object with a `write` method is supported.\n\n         silent:\n           By default, non-fatal error notifications are printed to stdout, but\n           this keyword may be set to disable these notifications.\n\n         strict:\n           Execution of the model mapping will cease upon the first error\n           encountered.  The default behavior is to attempt to continue.\n        \"\"\"",
