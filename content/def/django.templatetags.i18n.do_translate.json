Make\n    sure that the string in there is something that is in the .po file.\n\n    It is possible to store the translated string into a variable::\n\n        {% translate \"this is a test\" as var %}\n        {{ var }}\n\n    Contextual translations are also supported::\n\n        {% translate \"this is a test\" context \"greeting\" %}\n\n    This is equivalent to calling pgettext instead of (u)gettext.\n    \"\"\"",
