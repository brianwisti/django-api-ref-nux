In the output, strings will keep their initial and trailing\n    quote marks and escaped quotes will remain escaped (the results can then\n    be further processed with unescape_string_literal()).\n\n    >>> list(smart_split(r'This is \"a person\\'s\" test.'))\n    ['This', 'is', '\"a person\\\\\\'s\"', 'test.']\n    >>> list(smart_split(r\"Another 'person\\'s' test.\"))\n    ['Another', \"'person\\\\'s'\", 'test.']\n    >>> list(smart_split(r'A \"\\\"funky\\\" style\" test.'))\n    ['A', '\"\\\\\"funky\\\\\" style\"', 'test.']\n    \"\"\"",
