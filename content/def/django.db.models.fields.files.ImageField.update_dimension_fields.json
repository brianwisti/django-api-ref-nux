However, dimensions\n        won't be updated if the dimensions fields are already populated.  This\n        avoids unnecessary recalculation when loading an object from the\n        database.\n\n        Dimensions can be forced to update with force=True, which is how\n        ImageFileDescriptor.__set__ calls this method.\n        \"\"\"",
