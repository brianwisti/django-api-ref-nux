    "docstring": "\"\"\"\n    Regroup a list of alike objects by a common attribute.\n\n    This complex tag is best illustrated by use of an example: say that\n    ``musicians`` is a list of ``Musician`` objects that have ``name`` and\n    ``instrument`` attributes, and you'd like to display a list that\n    looks like:\n\n        * Guitar:\n            * Django Reinhardt\n            * Emily Remler\n        * Piano:\n            * Lovie Austin\n            * Bud Powell\n        * Trumpet:\n            * Duke Ellington\n\n    The following snippet of template code would accomplish this dubious task::\n\n        {% regroup musicians by instrument as grouped %}\n        <ul>\n        {% for group in grouped %}\n            <li>{{ group.grouper }}\n            <ul>\n                {% for musician in group.list %}\n                <li>{{ musician.name }}</li>\n                {% endfor %}\n            </ul>\n        {% endfor %}\n        </ul>\n\n    As you can see, ``{% regroup %}`` populates a variable with a list of\n    objects with ``grouper`` and ``list`` attributes. ``grouper`` contains the\n    item that was grouped by; ``list`` contains the list of objects that share\n    that ``grouper``. In this case, ``grouper`` would be ``Guitar``, ``Piano``\n    and ``Trumpet``, and ``list`` is the list of musicians who play this\n    instrument.\n\n    Note that ``{% regroup %}`` does not work when the list to be grouped is not\n    sorted by the key you are grouping by! This means that if your list of\n    musicians was not sorted by instrument, you'd need to make sure it is sorted\n    before using it, i.e.::\n\n        {% regroup musicians|dictsort:\"instrument\" by instrument as grouped %}\n    \"\"\"",
