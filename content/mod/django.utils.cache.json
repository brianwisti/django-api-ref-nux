    "docstring": "\"\"\"\nThis module contains helper functions for controlling caching. It does so by\nmanaging the \"Vary\" header of responses. It includes functions to patch the\nheader of response objects directly and decorators that change functions to do\nthat header-patching themselves.\n\nFor information on the Vary header, see:\n\n    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.4\n\nEssentially, the \"Vary\" HTTP header defines which headers a cache should take\ninto account when building its cache key. Requests with the same path but\ndifferent header content for headers named in \"Vary\" need to get different\ncache keys to prevent delivery of wrong content.\n\nAn example: i18n middleware would need to distinguish caches by the\n\"Accept-language\" header.\n\"\"\"",
