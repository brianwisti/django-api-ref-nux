None denotes the absence of a savepoint.\n\n    This allows reentrancy even if the same AtomicWrapper is reused. For\n    example, it's possible to define `oa = atomic('other')` and use `@oa` or\n    `with oa:` multiple times.\n\n    Since database connections are thread-local, this is thread-safe.\n\n    An atomic block can be tagged as durable. In this case, raise a\n    RuntimeError if it's nested within another atomic block. This guarantees\n    that database changes in a durable block are committed to the database when\n    the block exists without error.\n\n    This is a private API.\n    \"\"\"",
