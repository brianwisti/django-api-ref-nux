It subclasses\n    MultiValueDict since keys in such data can be repeated, for instance\n    in the data from a form with a <select multiple> field.\n\n    By default QueryDicts are immutable, though the copy() method\n    will always return a mutable copy.\n\n    Both keys and values set on this class are converted from the given encoding\n    (DEFAULT_CHARSET by default) to str.\n    \"\"\"",
