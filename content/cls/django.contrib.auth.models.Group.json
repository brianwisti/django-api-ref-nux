    "docstring": "\"\"\"\n    Groups are a generic way of categorizing users to apply permissions, or\n    some other label, to those users. A user can belong to any number of\n    groups.\n\n    A user in a group automatically has all the permissions granted to that\n    group. For example, if the group 'Site editors' has the permission\n    can_edit_home_page, any user in that group will have that permission.\n\n    Beyond permissions, groups are a convenient way to categorize users to\n    apply some label, or extended functionality, to them. For example, you\n    could create a group 'Special users', and you could write code that would\n    do special things to those users -- such as giving them access to a\n    members-only portion of your site, or sending them members-only email\n    messages.\n    \"\"\"",
