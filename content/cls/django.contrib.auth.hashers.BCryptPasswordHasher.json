Please be warned that\n    this library depends on native C code and might cause portability\n    issues.\n\n    This hasher does not first hash the password which means it is subject to\n    bcrypt's 72 bytes password truncation. Most use cases should prefer the\n    BCryptSHA256PasswordHasher.\n    \"\"\"",
